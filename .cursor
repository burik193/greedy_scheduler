# WarmStart - UV Project Configuration

This is a **uv project** that uses Python's modern package manager and environment system.

## Important: Environment Activation Required

**Before running ANY commands in the console, you MUST activate the uv environment:**

```bash
# Activate the uv environment
uv shell

# Or run commands directly with uv
uv run python your_script.py
uv run pytest
uv run mypy .
```

## Why This Matters

- UV manages Python dependencies and virtual environments automatically
- Running commands without activating the environment will fail or use the wrong Python version
- The agent should always activate the uv environment before executing console commands
- This ensures all dependencies are available and the correct Python version is used

## Project Structure

This project uses uv for:
- Dependency management (`pyproject.toml`)
- Virtual environment isolation
- Fast package installation and resolution
- Modern Python tooling

## Agent Instructions

When the agent needs to run console commands:
1. **Always activate the uv environment first** using `uv shell`
2. **Or prefix commands with `uv run`** to execute them in the environment
3. **Never run Python commands directly** without environment activation
4. **Use `uv add` for adding new dependencies**
5. **Use `uv sync` for installing/updating dependencies**

This ensures consistent behavior and prevents dependency-related errors.
